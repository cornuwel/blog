## Introduction

No Man's Sky is a game of exploration and survival in an infinite procedurally generated universe. One of the many challenges players face in this vast cosmos are the Sentinel Ships. These autonomous vessels patrol the skies and space, ensuring order and balance, but can also pose a significant threat to the unprepared traveler. However, since the Interceptor update, you can get your very own sentinel ship by following this process:

## Finding Sentinel Ships

1. **Warp to a Dissonant System**: Your journey begins in the galaxy map, where you'll need to warp to a Dissonant System. These systems are unique and can be identified by their distinct label on the map.
2. **Land on a Planet with Corrupted Sentinels**: Within the Dissonant System, you'll find at least one planet inhabited by Corrupted Sentinels. Make your landing here.
3. **Find a Dissonance Resonator**: Once on the planet, use your analysis visor to locate a Dissonance Resonator. Destroying this will yield either an Inverted Mirror or, if you're lucky, an Echo Locator.
4. **Activate the Echo Locator**: The Echo Locator, once activated, will guide you to a camp with a terminal. Here, you'll need to solve a simple math problem to unlock the terminal. Once unlocked, you can open the Multitool box on the left and activate a beacon that will lead you to a crashed Sentinel Ship.
5. **Retrieve the Hyline Brain**: Upon finding your ship, extract the Hyline Brain and activate it. This will reveal the location of a temple where you need to bring the brain.
6. **Install the Docile Brain**: At the temple, place the Hyline Brain to receive a new "Docile" brain. This can be installed on your ship, allowing you to take control of it.

If you don't want to spend the nanites to upgrade it, you can repeat steps 3 and 4 until you find an S-class Ship.

Remember, each Dissonant System has only one model of Sentinel Ship. If the ship you find doesn't suit your taste, simply warp to another Dissonant System and repeat the process until you find your perfect match.

## Upgrading Your Sentinel Ship

Now that you've taken control of a Sentinel Ship, it's time to make it truly your own. Upgrading your ship is a crucial part of No Man's Sky, and Sentinel Ships are no exception. The process is similar to upgrading a standard ship, but with a few key considerations. Beyond upgrading the class and storage slots at any space station, here's what you need to know:

1. **Use the Same Modules**: Sentinel Ships use the same upgrade modules as normal ships, even if the base components are named differently. This means you can apply any modules you've collected on your journey to enhance your Sentinel Ship's capabilities.
2. **Optimize for Adjacency and Supercharged Slots**: When installing upgrade modules, remember to place them adjacent to each other in your ship's inventory and take advantage of supercharged slots, enhancing the effect of the upgrades and making your ship even more powerful.
3. **Focus on Damage, Maneuverability, and Shields**: Sentinel Ships are akin to super-fighters, boasting impressive combat capabilities. To make the most of this, focus your upgrades on enhancing your ship's damage output, maneuverability, and shields. A fully upgraded infra-knife, for example, can reach an astounding 20,000 DPS.

Remember, upgrading your ship is a process of trial and error. Don't be afraid to experiment with different configurations to find the setup that suits your playstyle best.

## Conclusion

Finding, taking control of, and upgrading a Sentinel Ship in No Man's Sky is an exciting challenge that offers great rewards. With patience, strategy, and a bit of luck, you'll be navigating the cosmos in your very own, fully upgraded Sentinel Ship in no time. Happy exploring!
